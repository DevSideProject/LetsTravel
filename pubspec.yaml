    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CairoRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cairo_regular.ttf

    - family: CairoSemiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cairo_semi_bold.ttf

    - family: CairoBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cairo_bold.ttf
